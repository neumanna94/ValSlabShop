## Specifications
This project goal is to outline the development process for a friends future business website.
The goal of this site is to manage a database and website display for a slab business that is scalable up to 10,000 people.
Furthermore, the main objective is to allow people to easily and freely view the logs on display. While providing easy contact and order requests.
In order to ensure this objective is reached, I will be using the Angular framework to make an agile and responsive page while generating content from a Firebase server or API calls.

## Objectives[Given by Epicodus]:
1. More directives (practice with ngIf, ngFor, and more).
  - ngIf[Conditionally Generate this View from JavaScript]
  - ngFor[Generate Database Content in View]
2. Full CRUD functionality that changes your models.
  - Updating the database model from the View.
3. Firebase (a noSQL database) isntead of a hard-coded dataset.
  - Connecting to a noSQL database and operating CRUD operations.
  - Seed data for your database.
4. Pipes for Filtering data.
5. A router for adding additional pages.
  - Pointing to actions of routes.
6. Authentication and route guards.
  - Finding a project for authentication.
7. Deployment(as a dry run for next week)
